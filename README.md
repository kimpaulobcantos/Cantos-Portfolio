MY REFLECTION
As an IT student, I thought at first that becoming an IT student was easy but as time went on I realized that I was wrong in thinking that being an IT student was easy. Like now that we have another project to do, a Web portfolio, I think it will be easy to do but I don't know how to start doing it even though we have already done it before but now I will do it again as if something is bothering my mind. and the information you will include here should be about yourself. so you must fully understand the things about yourself.
As I was creating my portfolio, I faced many challenges, such as questioning myself about how to start my portfolio, what information to include, how to design it, and what things I would need to begin and finish it. Aside from that, another challenge I encountered was how to organize the information I gathered. And it's not just in creating a web portfolio that you encounter challenges, but also in submitting it, because there are many processes to go through in order to submit it, such as how to add the file you created to the submission platform specified by your teacher. My solution to overcome those challenges was to research how to create a web portfolio. Another method I used was to make a plan on how I would create my portfolio. And for submitting my portfolio, my solution was to explore how to add a file to the uploading platform provided by my teacher.
And I think to have a better improvement in the portfolio you will make, first you should know a lot about yourself because this is where the information you will put in your portfolio will come from because a web portfolio is like a resume. And to make your portfolio even better, it should have a clear visual, simple and consistent, and responsive layout that can be viewed on Mobile, laptop, or tablet. And if you put text or information, it should be readable properly. The font you will use should also be appropriate, and the color of the backgrounds and images should be good and not hurt the eyes. And the organization of the information should be proper, like the alignment, spacing contrast, and so on. And the navigation should work properly, and there should be no repeated information or sections.
In conclusion, when you’re creating something, it’s important to have a plan or process to follow. This really helps in producing excellent and well-made work. For example, you can’t just jump into creating a web portfolio without planning first. That plan will guide you and make the process much easier. Also, when you’re creating something, you shouldn’t only consider your own preferences, but also take into account the preferences of others.
